			<p id="p1"> Stanley Kubrick, (born July 26, 1928, Bronx, New York, U.S.â€”died March 7, 1999, Childwickbury Manor, near St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England), American motion-picture director and writer whose films are characterized by his dramatic visual style, meticulous attention to detail, and a detached, often ironic or pessimistic perspective. An expatriate, Kubrick was nearly as well known for his reclusive lifestyle in the English countryside as for his painstaking approach to researching, writing, photographing, and editing his infrequent but always much-debated films.</p>

			<p id="p2">A demanding perfectionist, Kubrick assumed control over most aspects of the filmmaking process, from direction and writing to editing, and took painstaking care with researching his films and staging scenes, working in close coordination with his actors and other collaborators. He often asked for several dozen retakes of the same scene in a movie, which resulted in many conflicts with his casts. Despite the resulting notoriety among actors, many of Kubrick's films broke new ground in cinematography.<br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick" target="_blank">Click here for More info.</a></p>
